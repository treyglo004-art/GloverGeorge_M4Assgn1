# Budget Tracker - Skeleton Code

This is the starter version of my budget tracker app. I did use AI to assist me in creating the skeleton code.
It includes a minimal backend and frontend.
The backend stores expenses in a SQLite database and the frontend displays them.

## Backend
- Node.js + Express
- SQLite database
- Endpoints:
  - GET /expenses
  - POST /expenses

## Frontend
- React app
- Add expense form
- List of expenses pulled from backend

## Running the app
### Backend:
### Frontend:

## Notes
Comments added in code show basic function of lines listed directly under comments.
